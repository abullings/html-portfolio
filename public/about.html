<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
 My name is Abdullah Riaz, and I am an experienced Project/Program Manager with a robust background in leadership, community service, and technical expertise.<br/>
I hold an Associate’s and Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science.<br/>

<p> My journey in leadership began as the president of the Muslim Students Association (MSA) at Collin County Community College in 2018. <br />
This role was a stepping stone that led me to further leadership positions, including serving as the secretary of the MSA at the University of Texas at Dallas (UT Dallas) in 2020, and subsequently, as the vice president in 2021. <br />
These roles honed my skills in organizational management, event coordination, and team leadership.<br />
</p>

<p>From 2020 to 2022, I was a dedicated board member at the ISRA Foundation, where I managed various teams, led weekly halaqa events, spearheaded their Islamic summer school and coordinated the Young Professionals Team. <br />
My efforts in organizing multiple fundraising events resulted in raising over $500,000 for the foundation.<br />
 Additionally, I had the honor of leading taraweeh prayers during Ramadan. <br />
 </p>

<p>Professionally, I began my career as a project manager at Ethos Group in Irving, where I successfully managed numerous projects, driving efficiency and ensuring timely delivery.<br />
 Currently, I am a Program Manager at AT&T, working with the Data Center Consolidation Team. <br />
 In this role, I oversee complex projects, coordinate cross-functional teams, and ensure seamless integration and consolidation of data centers.<br />
